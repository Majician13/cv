          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p class="bio-descrip">I started programming at the age of 5 when I typed in my first BASIC program. It only brought up a color picture of a dragon, but I loved knowing I could do more with computers. Throughout my life, I've continued learning as much as I could about computers. At 17, I started repairing and building desktop computers. I learned HTML and CSS. In 2000, I taught a beginning programming course at New River Community College because the teacher knew I was going to be bored in the class. She had me teach the class, re-write the book, and write and grade the exams. I am now trying to learn many programming languages fluently so I can begin a career programming.</p>

            <h3>Mentalism</h3>
            <p>I am a professional Mentalist, meaning I read and persuade the mind. This has been an obvious help in any customer service job I've had as well as getting to know people. I've always had a love for psychology and a curiosity of why people do what they do. </p>
